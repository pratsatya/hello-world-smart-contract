NEAR SPRING POP-UP HACKATHON

Challenge #2. Hello world smart contract
This is a 2-step challenge for building your first smart contract and a frontend for the whole world to see. The solution can be as simple or complex as you like!
Step 1.
Create a Hello World smart contract with the Rust SDK. If you're not sure where to get started, have a look here: https://www.near-sdk.io/. And if youâ€™re brand new to Rust, check out our quick-start guide: https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/contracts/rust/intro. When we call the contract, it should take a {name} parameter and return "Hello {name}!". Deploy your Hello World smart contract on the testnet.
Step 2.
Build and deploy a frontend for your smart contract (GitHub Pages is the most simple option). The user should enter their name, call the contract, and see "Hello {name}!". Share the link to this channel for us to review.
